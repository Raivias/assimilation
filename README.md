# Assimilation!
Assimilation is an altered version of tag where the teams grow

## Rules
1) On creation each agent is assigned a team(color)
2) Agents are able to fire their color in the form of bullets at other agents
3) If an Agent is hit by a bullet it becomes an agent of that team

## TODO
- Make bullets impact
- Bound edges of simulation
- Make agents move
- Make intelligent shots
